When a phenol containing chemical is mixed with Ferric Chloride, a colorful, iron complex is formed. The color depends on the actual phenol chemical used, but can include blue, violet, purple, green, or red-brown colors.

Phenols are a type of alcohol (Oxygen bonded with Hydrogen) that is attached to a special carbon ring called an aromatic ring. Being attached to an aromatic ring lets the hydrogen be taken off easier, allowing for the oxygen to instead bond to the iron. This exchanges itself with the chloride already on the iron resulting in the iron complex.
