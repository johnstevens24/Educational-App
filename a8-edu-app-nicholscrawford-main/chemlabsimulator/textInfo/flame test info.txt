All elements have a shell or shells of electrons. Some have a tighter or loser hold to these electrons.

Some metals have a loose enough hold on them that when they are heated up (put in a flame) their electrons can go up a layer or shell. When that electron falls back down to where it is supposed to be it releases energy in the form of light.

Different metals allow their electrons to go different distances away from where they started resulting in different colored light.
