Decomposition is a basic type of chemical reaction which breaks one larger molecule into smaller parts.

The combustion(burning) of propane, like other hydrocarbon chains, produces water and carbon dioxide as long as there is enough oxygen. If there isnâ€™t enough oxygen, the same reaction produces deadly carbon monoxide. This reaction releases a lot of energy.

This is the same basic reaction used for powering the majority of cities and cars. It is the same basic process as burning gasoline or coal.
